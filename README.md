🧩 About the Project

StonedMonmies is a lore-driven NFT collection that fuses ancient Egyptian mysticism with futuristic blockchain mythology.

The project tells the story of eight explorers who uncover Zerzura, a hidden city where history, time, and code intertwine.

Each NFT represents a Monmy, an awakened mummy holding traits tied to its artifact and story.
